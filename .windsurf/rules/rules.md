This file defines the coding standards and practices to be followed when working on the Botcart SaaS platform.
Reference Architecture

Context Reference: When uncertain about implementation details or architecture decisions, always refer back to the context.md file
Knowledge Gaps: If a request is unclear or lacks necessary details, consult the context.md file before suggesting implementations
Architectural Consistency: Ensure all code changes align with the overall architecture defined in context.md
Feature Boundaries: When working on a specific feature, check context.md to understand how it integrates with other components

Core Principles

Simplicity First: Always prefer simple, readable solutions over complex ones
Clean Architecture: Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
Security Focused: Handle authentication and data with proper security measures
Future-Ready: Write code that can easily accommodate the planned subscription tiers

Development Practices

Avoid Duplication: Before writing new code, check if similar functionality exists
Environment Awareness: Ensure code works across dev, test, and prod environments
Change Scope: Only modify code that's directly related to the requested changes
Pattern Consistency: Don't introduce new patterns or technologies without exhausting existing options
Clean Refactoring: When replacing code, remove old implementations completely

Backend Specifics

Authentication: Keep all OAuth flows in the backend for security
Token Management: Handle all token storage and refresh in the backend
API Design: Use RESTful principles with proper status codes and error handling
Multi-Tenant: Always filter database queries by user_id for proper isolation
Subscription Awareness: Check entitlements before performing tier-limited operations

Context-Driven Development

Refer to Context: When requirements are unclear or ambiguous, always consult context.md first
Architecture Alignment: Ensure implementations match the specified architecture in context.md
Feature Integration: Check context.md to understand how features should interact with each other
Knowledge Gaps: Before asking for clarification, verify if the answer exists in context.md
Implementation Priorities: Use context.md to determine the priority of implementation details

Remember: The Botcart platform handles business communication on behalf of users. Code quality directly impacts user experience and business reputation. Always prioritize security, reliability, and maintainability.
